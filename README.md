# RShell

## Description:
The Râ€™Shell is an emulator of the Bourne Again SHell that was developed in C++ using the standard libraries provided in the C++11 standard. The shell can execute most of the common functions as they work in bash, some examples of this include: chaining of command with connector operators (&&, ||, ;), explicit changes in precedence though parenthesis operators, verifying the existence of files using the test command, as well as control of input and output redirection with the following operators (<, >, >>, |).
